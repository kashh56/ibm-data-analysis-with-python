Project Overview 🏠
-------------------

In this project, we analyzed a **housing dataset** to build predictive models for house prices. We applied techniques such as **data preprocessing, scaling, polynomial transformations, and Ridge regression** to generate models and evaluated their performance using **R² scores**.

The **goals** of the project included:

*   **Data Cleaning**: Handling unnecessary columns and missing values.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating box plots, regression plots, and statistical summaries.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Transforming data using polynomial features.
*   **Modeling**: Creating Ridge regression models and measuring performance using R².

Files 📂
--------

*   `housing_data.csv`: The original dataset used for the project.
*   `final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the project code and analysis.
*   `README.md`: This file, documenting the project details.

Key Steps 🛠️
-------------

### 1\. Data Preprocessing

*   **Checked data types** using `df.dtypes`. ✅
*   **Dropped unnecessary columns** (`id` and `Unnamed: 0`) and used `describe()` to obtain a statistical summary of the DataFrame.

### 2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*   **Generated visualizations** including box plots and regression plots.

### 3\. Feature Engineering

*   **Applied polynomial transformations** to enhance model performance.

### 4\. Modeling

*   **Created and fit Ridge regression models** with a regularization parameter set to 0.1.
*   **Calculated R² scores** to evaluate model performance.

Results 🎉
----------

Throughout the project, the following R² scores were obtained:

*   Approximately 0.49285
*   Approximately 0.657695
*   Approximately 0.75133
*   Approximately 0.647
*   Approximately 0.7

Conclusion 📌
-------------

This project successfully demonstrated the application of data science techniques to predict housing prices. The models built were evaluated and refined, achieving satisfactory R² scores that reflect a reasonable fit to the data.
